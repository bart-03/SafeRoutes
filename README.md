# SafeRoutes

The idea behind this project was to create a web app that targets one or more of the united Nations goals. Our project was a web app that was a "safe" verssion of google maps where it used Dijkstras algorithm as well as user 
submitted data (reports) in order to return the fastest but also safest route.

I was in charge of the reporting feature and the log in and some essential navigatory and aesthetic features.

I used resful APIs to retreive data from the backend or to send data to the backed, at an SQL server.
The front end was following the REACT.js framework and we used express for the backend.

Here are some screenshots of the app and my features:
